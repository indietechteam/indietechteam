## Using ZenHub with GitHub Issues

1. Make sure you have accepted all of your invites/you have access to all of the Github repositories you are going to be working on.
2. Install the [Zenhub extension for Chrome or Firefox](https://www.zenhub.com/extension) - this give you extra features, adding a new ZenHub tab right within Github.
3. Login to [Zenhub](https://app.zenhub.com/)

And there you go, you can see your Issues in the boards view both on [Zenhub](https://app.zenhub.com/) (which is useful for working on multiple projects at once) and on the new "Zenhub" tab which will now be on all of your Github repositories.
